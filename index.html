            The in-silico pre-clinical development acts as the foundation for therapeutic discovery. 
            Despite its importance, it often oversimplifies biological processes and suffers from various challenges, such as low predictive accuracy, small-scale analysis, and reliance on reference biological data. This creates a vicious try-and-error cycle between the pre-clinical and clinical phases to find suitable pharmaceutical interventions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This problem stems from our very limited understanding of biological systems, which are primarily governed by proteins and their interactions. Large-scale computational approaches can address this problem and will enable us to dramatically improve our knowledge on proteins.
          </p>
          <p>
            LabSae provides a holistic analysis of biological systems at molecular resolution.
